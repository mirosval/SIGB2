\section{Introduction}

In this assignment we were tasked to explore various applications of homographies. Like the first assignment, to obtain our goal we used Python and OpenCV as a toolkit. The purpose is to learn how to use homographies because it’s related to both computer vision and computer graphics applications and is in general very useful for many applications. 

In this assignment we covered some used of homographies like point transfers, texture mapping, camera calibration and some of the beneﬁts of having a calibrated camera, however we can’t cover all of the homographies uses because the time available for us is limited and there is extreme range of situation that homographies can be useful.
